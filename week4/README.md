# CMEE Coursework - week 4:

This README file contains details about the scripts from in-classwork and practicals for the forth week.

## Description
Statistics in R, mostly using data on sparrows - "Stats with Sparrows"! More information about the R scripts and Biological Satistics could be found in [Lecture_Material](https://github.com/AnqiW222/CMEECourseWork/tree/main/week4/Lecture_Material)
## Language

R

## Dependencies
For some scripts in this directory, packages [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/), [WebPower](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WebPower/index.html), and [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) are required. 
Please run the following script in **R/RStudio** for package installation: 
```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "WebPower", "lme4"))
```

_The installation commands are used for MacOS, may varied with the different operating system._
